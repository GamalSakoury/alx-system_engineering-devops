the command that I used to print he current working abs path is pwd
to list the content I used ls
to go to the home I will use cd with ~ or without
to list in the long format then use ls [option] option is -l
to list sorted long format I used ls -l -a -1v
to make adir in tmp then use mkdir ../../tmp/my_first_directory
to move I used mv
